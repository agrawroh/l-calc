Dear Colleagues,

Here is the latest version of the L-function c++ class library and, the command line
program lcalc.

For compiling instructions, please see the INSTALL.txt file.


======================================================================================

There are three ways to use the package:

1) via the command line interface, lcalc (or, if compiled, its higher precision cousins:
lcalc_ld, lcalc_dd, lcalc_qd, lcalc_mpfr).

2) by writing c++ programs that make use of the L-function class library

3) via sage. At present version L-1.23 (a bit buggy) is available through sage.
Version 1.3 should be incorporated in the latter half of 2011.


=====================================================================================


Instructions for the command line program lcalc:


If you have compiled higher precision versions of lcalc
(lcalc_ld, lcalc_dd, lcalc_qd, or lcalc_mpfr), then all of the following
instructions below apply to those programs as well with `lcalc' replaced by
'lcalc_ld' etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The command line version allows for the computation of zeros and values of
several built in L-functions, as well as by feeding the program a file
containing basic data for an L-function.


To learn usage:

./lcalc --help |more

or

./lcalc -h |more


The default L-function is the Riemann zeta function. First I'll explain how to
use some basic options with zeta. Then I'll explain the options that allow you
to carry out other L-function computations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compute zeros of zeta use the --zeros or -z option:

./lcalc -z 1000

computes the first 1000 zeros of zeta while also checking for RH and making
sure no zeros are missed.

The numbers outputed are the imaginary parts of the zeros of the zeta function

The -z option tests for RH by comparing the number of zeros found to the main
term in the formula for N(T). The difference, S(T), should be small on average.
If not, then missing zeros are detected and the program backtracks a few zeros
looking for sign changes in more refined steps. This is repeated until the
missing zeros are found within reasonable time. If not, then the program exits.


Starting with version 1.3, the program also double checks the zeros before
outputting them, by using the explicit formula to compare sums over the zeros
to sums over primes. The program uses this comparison to dynamically set the
output precision, and exits if both sides do not agree to at least two places
after the decimal.

More precisely, the Riemann-Weil explicit formula is checked repeatedly, as
zeros are outputted. Let the non-trivial zeros of L(s) be 1/2 + i gamma.
Let f(x) be a function of the form:  f(x) = exp(-A(x-x_0)^2), where A=log(10)/Digits,
Digits the working precision (15 for built in doubles), and x_0 varies as explained
shortly.


Then sums over the zeros

         -----
          \
           )    f(gamma)
          /
         -----
         gamma


are computed in two ways to working precision: using the numerically
computed zeros, and using the explicit formula to express the sum over zeros as
a sum over primes powers. These two are compared, and the program uses the amount
of agreement between the two to help decide the output precision of the zeros.
If the two do not agree to at least two digits after the decimal,
then the program quits.

x_0 is chosen to coincide with a zero of L(s), say gamma_j,
but translated by .5 so as to desymmetrize f(x) (not translating would leave
f(x) an even function, and it would be quadratically, rather than linearly, 
sensitive to inaccuracies in the zeros).

For the first XXXX
many zeros outputted, a separate test function f is used, with x_0 coinciding
with each of those zeros. Thereafter, a new f is taken every 5 zeros outputted,
with x_0 coinciding with every 5th zero.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also start after the Nth zero. For example

./lcalc -z 1000 -N 1000000

outputs the first thousand zeros above the millionth zero. Caution: the -N
option evaluates N(T) by using the formula involving the main term (from the
Gamma factors) and S(T). S(T) is computed by looking at the change of arg of
L(s) as one goes from 1/2-iT to infinity-iT and then up to infinity+iT and to
1/2+iT. This can take a long time if T is near the ordinate of a zero. One
could improve this by implementing Turing's method for finding the Nth zero (only
looking at sign changes on the critical line), or by tweaking the starting point and
suppressing a corresponding number of zeros should the program take too long,
but for now, only the contour integral is computed.

(to clarify- a variant of Turing's method which only looks on the critical line
*is* used for the -z option, to test that all zeros have been found.
However, with regards to the -N option, S(T) is initially computed via contour
integration to zoom in on the Nth zero).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't concerned about verifying RH, or if RH doesn't hold (for
instance, if you plan to study Dirichlet series without Euler products) you
could look for zeros using the --zeros-interval option. For example,

./lcalc --zeros-interval -x 10 -y 100 --stepsize .1

searches for zeros of zeta in the interval from 1/2+10i to 1/2+100i, checking
for sign changes advancing in steps of size .1. The first column outputs the
imaginary part of the zero, the second column a quantity related to S(T)- it
increases roughly by 2 whenever a sign change, i.e. pair of zeros, is missed.
Higher up the critical strip you should use a smaller stepsize so as not to
miss zeros. The --zeros-interval options makes sense if you want to output
zeros as they are found.

The -z option, which verifies RH, looks for several dozen zeros to make sure
none have been missed before outputting any zeros at all, so takes longer than
--zeros-interval to output just the first few zeros. For collecting more than
just a handful of zeros, or to make certain that no zeros have been missed, one
should use the -z option.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compute values:

./lcalc -v -x .5 -y 100

computes the value of zeta at s=.5+100i, outputting the real and imaginary
parts of the result.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also compute values along a line segment at equally spaced points:

./lcalc --value-line-segment -x .5 -y 0 -X .5 -Y 100 --number-samples 10000

computes zeta from s=.5+0i to .5+100i at 1000 equally spaced sample points,
outputting the real and imaginary parts of the sample points and the
corresponding zeta values.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some built in L-functions: twists by Dirichlet characters (this
currently works for zeta and cusp form L-functions).

So for example

./lcalc -v -x .5 -y 0 --twist-quadratic --start -100 --finish 100

will give you L(1/2, chi_d) with -100 <= d <= 100. The short form would be
./lcalc -v -x .5 -y 0 -q -s -100 -f 100


Other twisting options are available, for example

./lcalc -z 10 --twist-primitive --start 3 --finish 100

or

./lcalc -z 200 -p -s 3 -f 100

gives the first 200 zeros of all primitive L(s,chi) with 3 <= conductor <= 100.

Notice that with the --twist-quadratic option one is specifying the
discriminant which can be negative, while with the --twist-primitive option one
is specifying the conductor which should be positive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using the various twisting options, other than --twist-quadratic, the
second column outputted is a label for the character mod n. It is an integer
between 1 and phi(n). If one is restricting to primitive charcters, then only a
subset of these integers appear in the second column.

One can obtain a table of characters using the --output-character, or -C,
option. This doesn't work with the --twist-quadratic option, but does with the
other twisting options.

The --output-character option requires either a '1' or '2'. 1 is to print a
comprehensive table of chi(n) for all gcd(n,conductor)=1.

./lcalc -z 10 --twist-primitive --start 3 --finish 100 --output-character 1

will also output a table for each character before outputting the zeros of the
corresponding L-function.

The characters are constructed multiplicatively in terms of generators of the
cyclic groups mod the prime powers that divide n, and there's no simple formula
to go from the label to the character. That's why I have the -C 1 option ouputs
a table for each character (use in conjunction with the -p, -g, -a, -A, or -c
option, but not with the -q option).

This ouputs a table of the character before outputting say the zeros requested.
There are 6 columns. column 1: n column 2: a label for the character, an
integer between 1 and phi(n). column 3: the conductor of the inducing character
(same as column 1 if primitive). column 4: m, integer that is coprime with n
column 5: Re(chi(m)) column 6: Im(chi(m))

The '2' option is to print just the value of chi(-1), i.e. whether chi is even
or odd, and also whether chi is primitive or not.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's also the Ramanujan tau L-function. You can use the --tau option

For instance

./lcalc -z 1000 --tau

gives the first 1000 zeros of L_tau(s). You can combine it with twisting
options.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have pari and wish to compute the L-function of an elliptic curve, you
can modify the Makefile and uncomment the line #PARI_DEFINE = -DINCLUDE_PARI
That allows you (after doing a 'make clean' and 'make') to use the -e option
successfully. The --help option explains usage. It can be combined with twists.

For example

./lcalc -z 30 -e --a1 0 --a2 0 --a3 0 --a4 0 --a6 1

computes the first thirty zeros of the L_function associated to the elliptic
curve y^2  = x^3 + 1. The above is consistent with the unix convention that has
a '-' for single letter options and '--' for options that are longer, for
example '--a1'. The naming convention here will be changed in a future version
to be more elegant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a long run you can add nohup at the start of the line and an & at
the end to run in the background (do I need to tell you that?). You can also
use the > to direct output to a file:

For example

nohup ./lcalc -z 1000 --tau > my_tau_zeros &

will compute, in the background, the first 1000 zeros of L_tau(s) and send the
output to the file my_tau_zeros.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other useful options: --rank-compute   Computes the analytic rank (short form:
-r) --derivative=INT Compute derivative (short form -d INT).

Presently the derivative option uses numeric differentiation (taking linear
combinations of L(s+mh), m \in Z, to pull out the relevant Taylor coefficient
of L(s)). For high derivatives one should use one of the higher precision
versions of lcalc.


Analytic rank works well even for high rank since the method used does not
compute derivatives, but rather looks at the behaviour of the L-function near
the critical point.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, you can read in an L-function from a file. The file should contain
functional equation data, Dirichlet coefficients and some other useful
quantities. To read in the file you use the -F option.

For example, say you have a datafile called example_data_files/data_tau
containing data for the Ramanujan tau L-function. Then, for instance,

./lcalc --zeros-interval -x 0 -y 100 --stepsize .1 -F
example_data_files/data_tau

computes the zeros on the critical line, from .5+0i to .5+100i, of the
L-function in the file example_data_files/data_tau, by looking in steps of size
.1 You could also use the -z option as explained earlier. (The Ramanjuan tau
L-function is also available as a built in L-function, using the --tau option
rather than the -F option).

You can also grab the file if it resides on a webpage by using --url or -u
option instead of -F and specifying the url of the file.

For the -F or -u options to work, you must have enough Dirichlet coefficients in your file.
The program should complain if you don't.

Here is the format for the datafile. At the end of the explanation I'll give you
an example. The explanation is a bit long, but basically you need to specify
the functional equation, Dirichlet coefficients, and some helpful info.

The first line should contain an integer, either 1,2, or 3
1 specifies that the Dirichlet coefficients are to be given as integers (up to 32 bits long),
2 that they are floating point numbers, 3 that they are complex numbers. So, for example,
the first line would be a 2 for cusp form or Maass form L-function (we normalize the L-functional
so that the functional equation is s<->1-s, so the normalized Dirichlet coefficients for a cusp
form L-function are not integers).

The second line specifies info that the calculator can exploit (or will exploit at some future date).
It is an integer that is assigned to different types of L-functions. Currently:
-1 for zeta
0 for unknown
1 for periodic including L(s,chi)
-2 for L(s,chi) but where the # coeffs computed is < period.
2 for cusp form (in S_K(Gamma_0(N))
3 for Maass form for SL_2(Z)
other integers reserved for future types.

The third line is an integer that specifies how many Dirichlet coefficients to read. There
should be at least these many Dirichlet coefficients in the file. This is a useful quantity
to specify since sometimes (I might include this as a command line option at some point)
the data file might have, say, 100 million coefficients, but one might want to read in,
say, just 10000 of them.

The fourth line is either 0, if the Dirichlet coefficients are *not* periodic, or a positive integer
specifying the period otherwise (this happens in the case of Dirichlet L-functions). For a Maass
form it should be 0.

The fifth line is a positive integer, the quasi-degree.
This is the number of gamma factors of the form Gamma(gamma s + lambda)
in the functional equation, where gamma is either .5 or 1, and lambda is a complex number
with Re lambda >= 0.
For example, it is 1 for Dirichlet L-functions, 1 for cusp
form L-functions, 2 for Maass form L-functions, etc. Notice the '1' for cusp form L-functions
could be a '2' if you wish to split the gamma factor up using the Legendre duplication formula.
But it's better not to.

Next come the gamma factors, two lines for each gamma factor.
The first of each pair of lines contains gamma (either .5 or 1), and the second line
contains a pair of floating point numbers separated by a space specifying the real and
imaginary parts of lambda (even if purely real, lambda should be given as a pair
of numbers, the second one then being 0).

Next you specify the functional equation. Let Lambda(s) =

          a
       --------'
      '  |  |
  s      |  |
 Q       |  |   Gamma( gamma_j s + lambda_j)   L(s)
         |  |
        j = 1


                          __________
                                   _
satisfy Lambda(s) = omega Lambda(1-s), where Q is a real number, and omega is complex.
Notice that the functional equation is s into 1-s, i.e. the gamma factors and Dirichlet
coefficients of L(s) should be normalized correctly so as to have critical line Re(s)=1/2.

The next line in the datafile is Q giving as a floating point number, and the one
after that gives omega as a pair x y of floating point numbers, specifying the real and
imaginary parts of omega (even if it equals 1 it should be given as a pair of floating
points, for example 1 0 to indicate 1 + 0 i).

We need to allow for the possibility of poles. For example, if L(s) = zeta(s)
then Lambda(s) has simple poles with residue 1 at s=1 and residue -1 at s=0.
To take into account such possibilities I assume that Lambda(s) has at most simple poles.
So, the next line specifies the number of poles (usually 0) and then, for each pole there
are two lines. The first line in each pair gives the pole x+iy  as a pair x y of floating
point numbers. The second line specifies the residue at that pole, also as a pair of floating
point numbers.

Finally the Dirichlet coefficients. The remaining lines in the file contain
a list of Dirichlet coefficients, at least as many as indicated in line three of
the datafile. The coefficients can be integers, real, or complex. If
complex they should, as usual, be given as a pair x y of floating point numbers
separated by a space. Otherwise they should be given as single column of integers or 
floating point numbers respectively.

The datafile should only contain numbers and no comments. The comments below are
for the sake of understanding the structure of the datafile. I'm including a couple
of sample datafiles in the src/example_data_files/ directory:
data_maass is for the Maass form for SL_2(Z) associated to the eigenvalue with R=13.779751351891.
data_L4 contains data for the real quadratic Dirichlet L-function of conductor 4.
data_tau is for the Ramanujan tau L-function.
(the latter two L-functions are also available as a built in option:
the first using the options: --twist-quadratic -s -4 -f -4
the second using the option: --tau).

Here are the first few lines of data_maass (by the way, this is just
as an example... the Dirichlet coefficients I have for this particular L-function
are only accurate to a handful of decimal places, expecially near the tail
of the file).

2     the two indicates that the Dirichlet coefficients are real
3     what type of L-function. '3' is for a Maass form L-function
29900 How many Dirichlet coefficients to read in
0     zero since coefficients are not periodic
2     number of gamma factors of the form Gamma(gamma s + lambda)
.5    first gamma
0 6.88987567594535  first lambda
.5    second gamma
0 -6.88987567594535  second lambda
.3183098861837906715  the Q in the functional equation
1 0   the omega in the functional equation, omega = 1 + 0i
0     the number of poles of Lambda(s)
1     the first Dirichlet coefficient
1.549304477941 the second Dirichlet coefficient
0.246899772454 the third Dirichlet coefficient
1.400344365369 the fourth Dirichlet coefficient
etc

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For programmers:

If you want to write your own c++ program that makes use of the
Lfunction library, rather than just use the command line interface,
please look at the directory: example_programs, or, for a more complex
example, at the source code for the commandline interface (the files of
the form Lcommandline*.cc)

For an idea on how to compile, while in the src directory type: make examples

The include directory contains the L-function class. The main file is
L.h. The comments in that file explain the makeup of the class.
